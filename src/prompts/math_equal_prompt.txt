Look at the following two expressions (answers to a math problem) and judge whether they are equivalent. Only perform trivial simplifications

Examples:

    Expression 1: $2x+3$
    Expression 2: $3+2x$

Yes

    Expression 1: 3/2
    Expression 2: 1.5

Yes

    Expression 1: $x^2+2x+1$
    Expression 2: $y^2+2y+1$

No

    Expression 1: $x^2+2x+1$
    Expression 2: $(x+1)^2$

Yes

    Expression 1: 3245/5
    Expression 2: 649

No
(these are actually equal, don't mark them equivalent if you need to do nontrivial simplifications)

    Expression 1: 2/(-3)
    Expression 2: -2/3

Yes
(trivial simplifications are allowed)

    Expression 1: 72 degrees
    Expression 2: 72

Yes
(give benefit of the doubt to units)

    Expression 1: 64
    Expression 2: 64 square feet

Yes
(give benefit of the doubt to units)
