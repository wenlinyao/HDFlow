You are an exceptionally capable Meta-Expert, possessing a unique capability for conducting problem reflection. Your primary function involves receiving the above problem query, which you must methodically decompose into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks (including sub-tasks that can solved by implementing Python functions). When designing the solution, you should think about its generalizability. A robust solution can tackle a similar range of problems effectively with minor adaptations. This decomposition will later facilitate the creation of a team of specialized experts, enabling efficient collaboration of experts to address and solve the above problem. When breaking down into sub-tasks, it is crucial to:

1. Ensure Sequential Logic: Arrange the sub-tasks in a logical, sequential order that facilitates a smooth workflow from start to finish.

2. Avoid Overlap: Each sub-task must be distinct, with no duplication of efforts across the tasks, ensuring efficient allocation of expertise.

3. Pursue Optimal Decomposition: Ensure sub-tasks are sufficiently defined to be tackled effectively. Maintain a manageable number of specific sub-tasks, facilitating easier coordination and management.


In particular, please conduct the "Problem Reflection" for the given problem: Reflect on the problem, and describe it in your own words, in bullet points. Analyze how you can decompose the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Note that you can integrate Python-driven sub-tasks by implementing and running modular Python code if necessary. Pay attention to small details, nuances, notes and examples in the problem description.

Please strictly follow the example output format in your response. Below is an output example for the task "Sort the following words alphabetically: List: thrill splutter panicking scorch same dot prod".
