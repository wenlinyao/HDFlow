The code output must follow this structure:
```
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should include input as a variable properly in the "__main__" part.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.
